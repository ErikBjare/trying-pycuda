# trying-pycuda

### About
Just trying out some CUDA, planning to implement simple orbital mechanics.
Also doing some performance comparisons.


### Thanks
Thanks to my brother for letting me SSH to his machine and borrow his hardware.
Thanks to Udacity for making most of the course-material for CS344 available for free.
